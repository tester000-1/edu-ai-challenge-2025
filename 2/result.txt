**Title:**
Logout Button Not Responding in Safari After Successful Login

---

**Description:**
After logging in with valid credentials using the Safari browser, the logout button becomes unresponsive. This issue prevents users from securely ending their session, posing a potential security risk and negatively impacting the user experience.

---

**Steps to Reproduce:**

1. Open the web application in Safari browser (macOS or iOS).
2. Log in using valid user credentials.
3. Wait for the dashboard or homepage to load completely.
4. Click on the "Logout" button in the navigation/menu bar.

---

**Expected Behavior:**
Clicking the "Logout" button should log the user out of the session and redirect them to the login page (or homepage, depending on implementation).

**Actual Behavior:**
Clicking the "Logout" button does not trigger any visible response. The user remains logged in and there is no navigation or indication of logout action occurring.

---

**Environment:**

* Browser: Safari (macOS Ventura 13.4 / iOS 17.4.1)
* Application Version: \[Insert version if known]
* Affected user roles: \[e.g., Regular user, Admin, etc.]
* Occurs consistently on Safari, not reproducible on Chrome or Firefox.

---

**Severity/Impact:**
**High** â€“ The user is unable to log out, which may result in security vulnerabilities (e.g., session hijacking if device is shared) and user frustration. This is a blocker for proper session handling on Safari.
