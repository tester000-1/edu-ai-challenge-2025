# Audio Analyzer Console App

A cross-platform Java console application that accepts a spoken audio file, transcribes it using OpenAI's Whisper API, summarizes it using OpenAI GPT models, and extracts useful statistics like word count, speaking speed, and topic frequency. Results are saved to a file and displayed in the console.
